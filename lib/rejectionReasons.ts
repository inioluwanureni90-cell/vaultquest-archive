/**
 * VaultQuest Rejection Reason Codes and Explanation Objects
 *
 * This module provides user-facing explanation objects for rejected operations
 * across VaultQuest vault operations (deposit, withdraw, claim, draw_winner, etc.).
 *
 * Rejection categories:
 * - validation: Input/parameter validation failures
 * - permission: Authorization and permission failures
 * - policy: Protocol-level policy violations (caps, deadlines, lockups)
 * - stale_state: State consistency issues (concurrent modifications, stale data)
 * - external: External dependency failures (network, RPC, wallet)
 *
 * Each rejection reason includes:
 * - Stable reason code (for API contracts and logging)
 * - User-safe message (what went wrong)
 * - Recovery hint (what the user can do)
 * - Retryable flag (whether retrying without changes may succeed)
